An experimental compiler-driven, integrated CSS-in-JS solution

## Note

Today, we are living in the golden age of design tools.

We have great prototyping tools like Figma that allows designers and developers to share the same component-driven thinking.

While component-driven thinking we eventually have a design system works both on tools and codebase.

But when the designer doesn't follow the component-driven thinking, the system only occurs in the codebase. Conversely, if the developer doesn't follow component-driven thinking, the value the design tool creates is greatly reduced.

The lack of interoperability of many design tools and CSS-in-JS solutions hinders the same component-driven thinking.

the design tokens is a great methodology to make initial building blocks but the methodology has a steep learning curve.

Here is an idea,

We each have our own language for building blocks. What if we had a compiler that converts each building block into a design tokens that works on both sides instead of creating each building block separately in code and design tools?
